Applied Industrial Internet of Things
Configuration of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

Aim
To construct a simple Local Area Network (LAN) and understand the concept and operation of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) using Cisco Packet Tracer by interconnecting PCs through an 8-port switch and LAN cables.

Problem Statement
In a computer network, devices communicate using IP addresses at the Network Layer and MAC addresses at the Data Link Layer. For successful communication, IP addresses need to be mapped to corresponding MAC addresses. This mapping is achieved using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
The challenge is to simulate a LAN setup in Cisco Packet Tracer and demonstrate the working of ARP, showing how devices resolve IP addresses into MAC addresses during communication.

Scope of the Solution
•	Demonstrates the working of ARP in a LAN environment.
•	Provides hands-on understanding of how network devices exchange ARP requests and replies.
•	Useful for students and professionals learning networking concepts like IP-to-MAC mapping, ARP tables, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
•	Can be scaled to larger networks with routers, servers, and multiple switches to understand ARP in more complex topologies.

Required Components
Software/IDE:
•	Cisco Packet Tracer
Hardware (Simulated in Packet Tracer):
•	1 × 8-port Switch
•	4 × PCs (or more as per design)
•	Straight-through LAN cables
